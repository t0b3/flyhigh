Basic Installation
==================

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Type `make install [prefix=dir]' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.

Windows
=======

Building flyhigh for windows includes these steps:

1. Install Qt SDK
2. Install sqlite
3. Install cmake
4. Install Perl (optional)
5. Install mysql development files (optional)
6. Build the qt mysql plugin (optional)
7. Build flyhigh

Steps in detail:

1. Install Qt Windows SDK, cmake, mingw
	 Easiest way may be downloading the Qt SDK online installer for windows,
	 available at http://qt.digia.com/Product/Qt-SDK/
	 Make sure you install the QtSources package!
	 Tested: Version 1.2.1, Qt 4.8.1
	 It is assumed that the Qt SDK is installed at the default location C:/QtSDK

2. Install sqlite
	 Download zip from www.sqlite.org and extract sqlite3.dll to C:\Windows\system32
	 Tested: Version 3.7.14.1

3. Install cmake
	 Download and install cmake from www.cmake.org.
	 Tested: Version 2.8.5

4. Install Perl
	 Surprise! If you forget to install perl, compiling qt will fail miserably,
	 without any decent error message.
	 There is a binary distribution of perl for windows at www.perl.org.
	 Install it and add the bin directory to the PATH variable.
	 Tested: 5.1.2.4

5. Install mysql headers and library
	 You can find a zip package of the community edition at www.mysql.com.
	 I didn't care for the fully blown mysql server on my Windows box, so
	 I just extracted the include and lib folders into C:\mysql.
	 Tested: Version 5.5.28

6. Build the Qt mysql plugin
	 This is only required if you intend to use a mysql database.
	 There's a guide how to do it here: http://www.cadcoder.com/index.php?id=51
	 I did it this way:
	 In the Start>Programme>Qt>Qt command prompt enter these commands:
	 - cd C:\QtSDK\QtSources\4.8.1\src\plugins\sqldrivers\mysql\
	 - qmake "INCLUDEPATH+=C:\\mysql\\include" "LIBS+=C:\\mysql\\lib\\libmysql.lib" -o Makefile mysql.pro
	 - mingw32-make
	 - qmake "INCLUDEPATH+=C:\\mysql\\include" "LIBS+=C:\\mysql\\lib\\libmysql.lib" -o Makefile mysql.pro "CONFIG+=release"
	 - mingw32-make
	 The files you're looking for are here: C:\QtSDK\QtSources\4.8.1\plugins\sqldrivers\mysql.
	 If you intend to use them for development purposes, copy them to C:\QtSDK\Desktop\Qt\4.8.1\mingw\plugins\sqldrivers.
	 qsqlmysqld4.dll (debug) and qsqlmysql4.dll (release) are the runtime libraries. Take
	 the one matching your flyhigh build configuration (probably "release") and place it
	 somewhere where flyhigh.exe is able to pick it up. There's a special mechanism how
	 Qt looks for its plugins. See here: http://doc.qt.digia.com/qt/deployment-plugins.html

7. Building flyhigh - finally
	 In the Start>Programme>Qt>Qt command prompt enter these commands:
	 - `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code
	 - mkdir build
	 - cd build
	 - cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
	 - mingw32-make


Creating the Windows installer
==============================

Windows users need installers, don't they? Here's how:

1. Install nsis (Get it from http://nsis.sourceforge.net/). Tested: Version 2.46.
2. Place all needed dll's (Qt, mysql, sqlite, mingw) in the win32/lib folder
3. Start nsis and run flyhigh.nsi script in the win32 folder
4. Test the installer!

We'll provide a Windows installer at our project page as soon as we are ready
with the windows version of flyhigh.
