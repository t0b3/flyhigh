Basic Installation
==================

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Type `make install [prefix=dir]' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.

Windows
=======

Building flyhigh for windows includes these steps:

1. Install Qt SDK
2. Install sqlite
3. Install cmake
4. Install Perl (optional)
5. Install mysql development files (optional)
6. Build the qt mysql plugin (optional)
7. Do a quirk for qextserial
8. Build flyhigh

Steps in detail:

1. Install Qt Windows SDK, cmake, mingw
	 Easiest way may be downloading the Qt SDK online installer for windows,
	 available at http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/sdk-windows-cpp
	 Tested: Version 1.1.2, Qt 4.7.3
	 It is assumed that the Qt SDK is installed at the default location C:/QtSDK

2. Install sqlite
	 Download zip from www.sqlite.org and extract sqlite3.dll to C:\Windows\system32
	 Tested: Version 3.7.7.1

3. Install cmake
	 Download and install cmake from www.cmake.org.
	 Tested: Version 2.8.5

4. Install Perl
	 Surprise! If you forget to install perl, compiling qt will fail miserably,
	 without any decent error message.
	 There is a binary distribution of perl for windows at www.perl.org.
	 Install it and add the bin directory to the PATH variable.
	 Tested: 5.1.2.4

5. Install mysql headers and library
	 You can find a zip package of the community edition at www.mysql.com.
	 I didn't care for the fully blown mysql server on my Windows box, so
	 I just extracted the include and lib folders into C:\mysql.
	 Tested: Version 5.5.15

6. Build the Qt mysql plugin
	 This is only required if you intend to use a mysql database.
	 Easiest (but maybe not the fastest) way to get the Qt mysql plugin is
	 to recompile the entire Qt library. Be warned: this takes, depending
	 on your box, up to several hours and eats at least 3 Gigs of disk space!
	 Here it goes:
	 In the Start>Programme>Qt>Qt command prompt enter these commands:
	 - cd C:\QtSDK\QtSources\4.7.3
	 - configure -debug-and-release -opensource -qt-sql-mysql -plugin-sql-mysql -qt-sql-sqlite -plugin-sql-sqlite -I C:\mysql\include -L C:\mysql\lib
	 - mingw32-make
	 - (go sleeping)
	 The file you're looking for is C:\QtSDK\QtSources\4.7.3\plugins\sqldrivers\qsqlmysql4.dll

7. Workaround for Qextserial uglyness
	 Qextserial uses a Qt header which is private by now. A (admitedly ugly)
	 workaround is copying this header to a location where the compiler
	 may pick it up: Create a directory C:\QtSDK\Desktop\Qt\4.7.3\mingw\include\QtCore\private
	 and copy qwineventnotifier_p.h there.

8. Building flyhigh - finally
	 In the Start>Programme>Qt>Qt command prompt enter these commands:
	 - `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code
	 - mkdir build
	 - cd build
	 - cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
	 - mingw32-make


Creating the Windows installer
==============================

Windows users need installers, don't they? Here's how:

1. Install nsis (Get it from http://nsis.sourceforge.net/). Tested: Version 2.46.
2. Place all needed dll's (Qt, mysql, sqlite, mingw) in the win32/lib folder
3. Start nsis and run flyhigh.nsi script in the win32 folder
4. Test the installer!

We'll provide a Windows installer at our project page as soon as we are ready
with the windows version of flyhigh.
