==== What is flyhigh ====
flyhigh is a unique software for Linux and Windows
It helps paraglider pilots to 
- configure gps-enabled flight instruments
- manage and visualize flights, waypoints and routes
- plan and optimize their next awesome FAI triangles!


==== Features ====
- SQL database for waypoints, routes, flights, gliders, airspaces
- Flight preparation: sync waypoints and routes with database and GPS
- Flight analysis: 2D plots with OLC optimization (gnuplot)
- Flight export in IGC or KML (GoogleEarth) file format
- Statistics (servicings, flights per year)
- Import airspaces from OpenAir
- Show flights on map (Google Maps, Swiss Map 100)
- Plan flights on Google Maps


==== Supported devices ====
Fully supported are
- Flytec 5020, 6015
- Bäuninger Competino, IQ Basic
Supported, but with limited configuration are
- Flytec 5030, 6020, 6030
- Bräuniger Competino+, Compeo, Compeo+


==== Supported OS ====
Any fairly recent Linux distribution should be ok. flyhigh is well tested on
debian and openSUSE.
We provide Windows binaries as well, but be aware that your are using those
at your own risk.


==== Binary packages ====
Binary packages are provided through the Open Build Service (http://openbuildservice.org/).
You may look for rpm and deb based packages for Your Favorite Linux Distribution (TM) at 
http://software.opensuse.org/search?q=flyhigh&baseproject=ALL&include_home=true
A Windows installer is available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/flyhigh/files/


==== Installation ====
Linux: Look for a fitting package at http://software.opensuse.org/search?q=flyhigh&include_home=true
       You may wish to add the obs repository to your package manager for automatic
       updates. Check http://en.opensuse.org//Portal:Build_Service for guidance.
Windows: Download and install gnuplot first! You'll find instructions how to do so
         at http://www.gnuplot.info/
         After that, download the latest flyhigh for windows installer from 
         http://sourceforge.net/projects/flyhigh and run it. That's it.


==== Database migration ====
Attention users of version 0.5 or below:
WARNING: Database model was totally redesigned in version 0.5.
There is a script to migrate to database version 2, without touching the old one.
But it's always a good thing to back up your data _in advance_!!!
For migration execute as root: # ./migrate2dbv2
For later versions, the database is migrated automagically on the first start
of flyhigh. Again, doing a backup first keeps you in good humour.


==== Requirements ====
Qt 4.3 or newer, including QtWebkit!
For storing data locally: sqlite3 3.6.19 or newer
For use with a dedicated SQL server: mysql 5.0 or newer should be fine


==== Why using mysql? ====
flyhigh supports 2 kinds of data storage: Either a local, file based storage or
a SQL database. If you want to share your waypoints and routes among colleagues,
you need to use a mysql database server. It can be located just anywhere, be it
locally on your machine, on your NAS (many of them are already equiped with a fully-
featured mysql server) or even "in the cloud".
If you intend to use flyhigh on your own, you are probably better off using
the sqlite configuration. But no worries, you can change to or from mysql
later on without any loss of data.


==== Roadmap ====
We plan to provide Mac packages. But don't ask for dates!
